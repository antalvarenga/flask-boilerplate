## Install locally

Run `$ ./scripts/local-bootstrap.sh` to:

- Install poetry;
- Create virtual environment;
- Install dependencies;
- Set up git hook scripts.

Set up the Postgres database with the configuration as in docker-compose.yml (easiest way is to spin up a container for that service running `$ docker compose up database -d`)

Run `$ ./scripts/upgrade-db.sh` to run migrations.


## Activate environment

`$ source .venv/bin/activate`
## Run local server

`$ ./scripts/server.sh`

## Run tests

`$ poetry run pytest {pattern/options}`

Make sure there is a database named flask_app_test in the same db server as the local db

## Run lint

`$ poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`

## Swagger UI
